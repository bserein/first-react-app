import React from 'react';
//good habit to have of importing react --> this is the es6 way and es5 way is with require
//with react functions have to return jsx
function FirstComponent(){
    return (
        
        <h1>This is cool. ðŸ¤ </h1>
        
    )
}

export default FirstComponent;
//exporting default is just exporting the function aka the component
